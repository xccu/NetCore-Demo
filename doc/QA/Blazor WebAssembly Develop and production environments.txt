To configure and read the environment in a Blazor app, you can follow the guidance provided by Microsoft Learn[1]. When running an app locally, the environment defaults to Development. When the app is published, the environment defaults to Production[1]. The environment can be set using any of the following approaches[1]:

1) Blazor start configuration: The environment can be set via startup configuration. For example, you can start Blazor in the Staging environment if the hostname includes localhost[1].
2) Blazor-Environment header: The environment can be specified for other hosting environments by adding the Blazor-Environment header[1].
3) Azure App Service: The environment can be set for Azure App Service[1].

Please note that Blazor WebAssembly is currently in preview and not officially supported for production use[2]. However, you can still use it in production at your own discretion[2].

For more information on how to host and deploy Blazor WebAssembly, you can refer to the Microsoft Learn documentation[3].
