LINQ query expressions are a syntactic sugar for writing queries using keywords like from, where, select, etc. They are translated into extension methods that operate on IQueryable<T> or IEnumerable<T> interfaces[1].

IQueryable<T> is an interface that allows querying a remote data source, such as a database, by translating the query into an expression tree that can be executed by the provider[2][3].

IEnumerable<T> is an interface that allows iterating over a collection of objects in memory using a foreach loop or a yield return statement[2].
